# Nail-Salon
My project is based on a made-up nail salons buisness website. At the top of the page there is a drop-down menu that has a home, service, and contact us selection. The home page shows an image slider that displays 6 images of previous works each for each of the two technicians, and at the bottom of this page it has a responsive contact section so that whoever veiws the site can schedule an appointment with them. The service page shows each of the technicians availble services and the prices for each. Both of these pages have a responsive contact section located at the bottom, where you can input your name, email, appointment request, and any comments you have, also when you submit this contact input it then has a pop-up message that appears at the top. Each page has a 'back to top' button as well that takes you to the logo located at the top of the page. My project's CSS list feature is a drop-down 'hamburger' navigation menu, it has 3 options to choose from and highlights which option you hover over with the curser. My projects JavaScript list features are a responsive contact form, that when submited goes to an email address and send a message to the user, and a image carousel/slider that users can navigate using arrows.
